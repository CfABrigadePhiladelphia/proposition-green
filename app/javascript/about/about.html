  About/Contest Rules
</h1>

<p>
  Proposition Green seeks to harness collective intelligence through online collaboration. Anyone can contribute to Proposition Green as long as their proposed idea, project applies to the Philadelphia Region.
</p>


<h2>
  Contests involve five main phases:
</h2>


<h3>
  Proposal Creation
</h3>

<p>
  Members of Proposition Green community create proposals. Proposals can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Describe future actions to be taken.
  </li>
  <li>
    Outline how those actions can be accomplished.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain why the actions are desirable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Quantify the impact the actions will have.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  Proposals can be created by individual community members or by teams. 
</p>
<p>
  Some proposals describe actions the proposal team themselves would like to carry out if they had the needed resources. 
</p>
<p>
  In other cases, proposals describe actions that other people or organizations (such as governments or businesses) could take
</p>


<h2>
  What are the goals of Proposition Green?
</h2>

<h3>
  The primary goals of the Proposition Green contests are to:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Harness the collective intelligence of large numbers of people around the Philadelphia Region to create proposals for what should do about global climate change in the Philadelphia Region. 
  </li>
  <li>
  By helping scientists, policy makers, business people, and concerned citizens to think constructively together about this problem, we believe it may be possible to create better solutions than what would have been developed otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Help to educate the general public about the real issues involved in global climate change. By giving large numbers of people an opportunity to work together themselves on proposals to address climate change, based on the best current scientific knowledge, we believe they will come to understand the issues better and be better able to participate in political decision-making.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a large-scale test of new collective intelligence approaches. Examples like Wikipedia and Linux show that it's now possible for large groups of people to work together on very complex problems in ways that would have been impossible even a decade ago. 
  </li>
  <li>
    The goals of this contest are not to advocate any particular position or point of view about global climate change.  Instead, we hope to provide a forum where the best ideas and information can be shared.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Who can participate?
</h2>

<p>
The contest is open to anyone in the Philadelphia region, regardless of age, nationality, or political viewpoint.
</p>
<p>
This contest, however, is void where prohibited by law. It is your responsibility to check with your local laws to make sure that this contest does not violate any applicable law or ordinance, and to make sure that you are eligible to participate.
</p>
<p>
If you are under 18 years old, you will need your parent or legal guardian to submit your proposal for you.
</p>
<p>
You may submit projects that you have previously published or exhibited so long as they conform to the entry guidelines and the rules of this contest.
</p>


<h2>
  How do teams work?
</h2>

<p>
  Individuals may create proposals by themselves, but participants are encouraged to form teams. 
</p>
<p>
  For instance, a team might include different people with expertise in
quantitative modeling, political analysis, writing, and artistic creation.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone who wants to join the team creating a specific proposal can request to join that team. 
</p>
<p>
  Then the current team members decide whether they want that person to join.
</p>

<h2>
  What are the Contest stages?
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Proposal creation:  In this phase, teams are invited to create proposals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Judging:  Expert Judges will review the completed proposals and select some as semi-finalists. For more on the judging criteria, see How will proposals be judged, below.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvement of semi-finalists:  Teams selected to participate in the semi-finals will be invited to improve their proposals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Voting and final judging:  The judges will review the Semi-Finalists and
select Finalists. All registered users of the Proposition Green will then be invited to vote for the finalist proposal they prefer.  The Judges will also select the proposals they believe are most promising.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>
  How will proposals be judged?
</h2>

Judges will be asked to evaluate proposals on the following criteria:

<ul>
  <li>
    Feasibility of the actions proposed in the proposal. Judges with different kinds of expertise will evaluate the technical, economic, social, and political feasibility of the proposals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Novelty of the proposal's ideas. Innovative thinking and originality in a proposal will be valued more than encyclopedic knowledge. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Impact on climate change (for example, for mitigation actions, the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions or for adaptation actions, the extent to which the actions counteract the effects of climate change) and desirability of other impacts (e.g. economic, social, lifestyle)
  </li>
  <li>
    Presentation quality. Proposals that are well-presented will be favored over those that aren't. Presentation quality includes how well written a proposal is, how well it uses graphics or other visual elements, and how compelling are its artistic representations of possible future worlds (if any).
  </li>
</ul> 

<p>
Winning proposals will be especially strong in at least one of the first three dimensions, and also well presented.
</p>

<p>
As a tie-breaker, Judges may also use the popularity of a proposal, as indicated by the number of people who support it.
</p>
